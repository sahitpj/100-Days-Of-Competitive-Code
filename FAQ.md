# FAQ

#### Is maintaining a Streak important?
Maintaning a streak would be a great motivation tool for you, however don't be stressed out if you a miss a day, however you have to compensate it by following it back with an extra one. 

#### Should I keep a journal?
Yes you should, and the best way to do that is to fork this repo, and commit to the Log daily. It’s helpful in two major ways: you will be able to look at the progress each day and see how far you’ve already come and it will be easier to find the motivation to continue, and the second one is that after you’ve done your 100 days, you will be able to analyze your experience better and see what worked and what didn’t.

#### Should I put my projects online?
Definitely. It’s great for accountability and motivation to know that the stuff you’ve worked on is accessible online to anyone who may wish to look at it. It will make you care about the end product more, and will lead to a more impressive result in the end. I suggest you put them on GitHub.

#### What is the most difficult part of this challenge?
The part where you have to sit down and start coding. Don’t postpone that or think about it at all, because you will rationalize yourself out of it. Approach it mechanically: sit down, open your laptop, launch your coding editor, and start typing. After 5 minutes, you will not feel any problems/procrastination/desire to stop.
