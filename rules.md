# Rules

1. Once you have commited to the following challenge, fork this repository and log your activity in the [log.md](log.md) file.
2. You must code for a minimum of one hour everyday, which includes coding on websites as mentioned before, or pickiong your own problem and solving them. Working on projects which involvement development such as App development, building Machine Learning models, should not be counted into this. 
3. Do Tweet out your day to day progress with the hashtag #100DaysOfCompetitiveCode, and feel free to share interesting questions you find and their solutions.
4. Feel free to add questions and their solutions to the following Repo, by adding them to the [Code](code) directory. 
5. Encourage a minimum of two others to take upo this challenge.
6. Important: (see No.5 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
